Port royal is a deck building game, meets pirate theme.
You buy cards over time which either bring you more capabilities, or what you are
really aiming for, give you victory points.

As its more on the easier side of things, this is a great game to explain someone to get started.
One nice aspect is that its not necessarily obvious early in the game you will win.
Unlike other deck building games, it has a bit of randomness involved.
The game also comes with a taking the chance effect, which make the group by excited.

Overall that's definitely a recommended game for anyone to play.
